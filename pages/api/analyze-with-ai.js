REVIEW ANALYSIS:
${placeDetails.reviews ? `- Total Reviews Provided: ${placeDetails.reviews.length}
- Review Timestamps for Velocity Analysis: ${placeDetails.reviews.map(r => `${r.relative_time_description} (Time: ${r.time})`).join(', ')}

${placeDetails.reviews.slice(0, 5).map((r, i) => `
  Review ${i + 1}:
  Rating: ${r.rating} stars
  Time: ${r.relative_time_description} (Unix timestamp: ${r.time})

`).join('\n')}
- Owner Response Analysis: ${placeDetails.reviews.filter(r => r.reply).length} out of ${placeDetails.reviews.length} reviews have owner responses` : '- No review details available for keyword analysis'}

CRITICAL REVIEW VELOCITY ANALYSIS:
Calculate review velocity (reviews per month) from the timestamps above. This is a CRITICAL prominence factor:
- Consistent new reviews signal an active, popular business
- Review velocity directly impacts local ranking
- Recent reviews (last 30 days) carry more weight than old reviews
- Businesses getting 3+ reviews/month rank significantly better than those with sporadic reviews

CRITICAL: Analyze the review text above for:
1. KEYWORD RELEVANCE - What products/services/experiences do customers mention? Do they align with the business type?
2. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - Overall positive/negative/mixed sentiment across reviews
3. KEYWORD PATTERNS - Repeated terms that indicate what the business is known for
4. LOCAL RELEVANCE - Do reviews mention location-specific terms, neighborhood, nearby landmarks?
5. REVIEW VELOCITY - How many reviews in the last 30 days? Last 90 days? Is there consistent flow?

ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS:
${placeDetails.user_ratings_total > 0 ? `- Review Engagement: ${placeDetails.user_ratings_total} total customer interactions` : ''}
${placeDetails.photos ? `- Photo Types Available: ${placeDetails.photos.length} photos uploaded` : ''}
${placeDetails.url ? `- Google Maps URL: Available` : '- Google Maps URL: Not available'}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Your scores MUST directly reflect the data above - different data = different scores
2. Be HARSH but FAIR - most businesses score 40-65/100 overall
3. Use these STRICT scoring guidelines:

CATEGORY OPTIMIZATION (Weight: 20% - CRITICAL FOR RELEVANCE):
Google states: "Primary category is the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT relevance signal"
This is THE #1 factor for matching searches to your business.

Scoring (max 100 points):
- Primary Category Perfect Match (50 points):
  * Is the primary category highly specific? (e.g., "Malaysian Restaurant" vs just "Restaurant")
  * Does it match the actual business type?
  * Examples: "Italian Restaurant" > "Restaurant", "Cosmetic Dentist" > "Dentist"
  * Award 50 points if specific and accurate, 30 if generic, 10 if wrong/missing

- Additional Categories (25 points):
  * Are there relevant secondary categories?
  * Do they support the primary category?
  * Maximum relevance = 25 points, some relevance = 15 points, none/wrong = 5 points

- Category-Keyword Alignment (25 points):
  * Do the categories align with keywords in reviews?
  * Do they match what customers actually say?
  * Strong alignment = 25 points, some alignment = 15 points, weak = 5 points

CRITICAL: Analyze the actual business categories provided and compare to business type and review keywords.

PROFILE COMPLETION (Weight: 20%):
- Start at 0 points
- Name + Address (always present): +10 points
- Phone Number: +15 points (critical for calls)
- Website: +20 points (critical for conversions)
- Business Hours: +20 points (critical for foot traffic)
- Business Description/Editorial Summary: +10 points
- Business Attributes (delivery, dine-in, takeout, etc): +15 points (shows detailed profile)
- Service/Product Details (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc): +10 points (helps customer decision)
Score this business based on what they ACTUALLY have.

REVIEWS & RATINGS (Weight: 35% - MOST IMPORTANT FOR PROMINENCE):
Rating Component (max 30 points):
- 4.8-5.0 stars: 30 points (excellent)
- 4.5-4.7 stars: 25 points (good)
- 4.0-4.4 stars: 20 points (average)
- 3.5-3.9 stars: 15 points (below average)
- 3.0-3.4 stars: 10 points (poor)
- Below 3.0: 5 points (critical issue)

Review Volume Component (max 35 points):
- 200+ reviews: 35 points (excellent)
- 100-199 reviews: 28 points (good)
- 50-99 reviews: 21 points (acceptable)
- 25-49 reviews: 14 points (needs work)
- 10-24 reviews: 7 points (poor)
- 0-9 reviews: 3 points (critical issue)

REVIEW VELOCITY - CRITICAL NEW FACTOR (max 20 points):
Analyze the review timestamps to calculate reviews per month:
- 5+ reviews/month in last 90 days: 20 points (excellent - very active)
- 3-4 reviews/month: 15 points (good - consistent growth)
- 1-2 reviews/month: 10 points (acceptable - needs acceleration)
- Less than 1/month: 5 points (poor - stagnant)
- No recent reviews (90+ days): 2 points (critical - inactive)

Review velocity is a TOP ranking factor - consistent new reviews signal business popularity and activity.

REVIEW QUALITY & RELEVANCE (NEW - CRITICAL FOR RANKING):
Analyze the actual review text provided above and adjust score based on:

Keyword Relevance (can add up to +15 bonus points):
- +15 points: Reviews contain highly relevant keywords (services, products, location-specific terms)
- +10 points: Reviews mention some relevant business aspects
- +5 points: Generic reviews with minimal business-specific keywords
- 0 points: Reviews lack specific keywords or details

Sentiment Quality (can add up to +10 bonus points):
- +10 points: Overwhelmingly positive sentiment (80%+ positive language)
- +7 points: Mostly positive sentiment (60-80% positive)
- +5 points: Mixed sentiment (40-60% positive)
- +2 points: Mostly negative sentiment (below 40% positive)
- Deduct 5 points: Many negative reviews with concerning patterns

Review Authenticity & Detail (can add up to +10 bonus points):
- +10 points: Reviews are detailed, specific, mention multiple aspects
- +5 points: Reviews have moderate detail
- +2 points: Very brief reviews (1-2 words)

Owner Response Rate (analyze from review data if available):
- Bonus: +5 points if owner responds to most reviews
- This shows active engagement and care for customers

IMPORTANT: Actually read and analyze the review text provided above. Look for:
- Product/service keywords (e.g., "pizza", "service", "atmosphere", "coffee")
- Location relevance (neighborhood names, nearby landmarks)
- Experience descriptors (fast, friendly, clean, delicious)
- Sentiment indicators (love, great, terrible, disappointing, amazing)

PHOTOS & VISUAL CONTENT (Weight: 15%):
- 50+ photos: 100 points (excellent)
- 30-49 photos: 80 points (good)
- 20-29 photos: 60 points (acceptable)
- 10-19 photos: 40 points (needs work)
- 5-9 photos: 20 points (poor)
- 0-4 photos: 10 points (critical)

ENGAGEMENT & ACTIVITY (Weight: 10%):
- Base score: 40 points
- Review Response Rate: +20 points if owner responds to reviews regularly
- Recent Reviews: +20 points if has reviews from last 30 days (check review velocity)
- Photo Recency: +10 points if photos appear recent/updated
- Q&A Section: +10 points if has Q&A activity (we have limited visibility to this)
- Deduct 30 points if business status is not OPERATIONAL
Note: If review data shows owner engagement, adjust score accordingly

LOCAL SEO OPTIMIZATION (Weight: 10%):
- Base score: 40 points
- Multiple business categories: +15 points (helps with discovery)
- Complete business attributes: +15 points (delivery, dine-in, accessibility, etc)
- Price level set: +10 points (helps customer expectations)
- Rich business types/categories: +10 points
- NAP (Name, Address, Phone) completeness: +10 points
- Deduct 20 points if critical data missing
